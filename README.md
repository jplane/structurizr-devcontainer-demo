# Structurizr VS Code devcontainer setup

- Familiarize yourself with the [C4](https://c4model.com/) software modeling approach

- Read through the [Structurizr docs](https://github.com/structurizr) and understand the relationship between C4 (a software design approach) and Structurizr (one possible tool for implementing that approach)

- Follow the setup instructions for [VS Code and devcontainers](https://code.visualstudio.com/remote/advancedcontainers/overview#_getting-started)

- Clone this repo and open VS Code in the location where you cloned it

- Select the 'Dev Containers: Reopen in Container' command within VS Code

- Once the container is initialized, browse to http://localhost:8080 to view the Structurizr diagrams

- Use the [Structurizr DSL reference](https://github.com/structurizr/dsl/blob/master/docs/language-reference.md) to modify [workspace.dsl](./workspace.dsl) as desired, and refresh your browser to see changes
